\section{Notable Projects}
\vspace{0.5em}


\noindent\begin{large}\textsc{Fitness Tracking App:}\end{large} (iOS, Android, with webapp admin portal)\\
Architected and implemented a fitness based app and admin portal. App interfaces with multiple third-party Bluetooth LE fitness wearables. Occasionally had to reverse engineer low-level SDKs. Reliably backup/restore data to/from the server, successfully taking variable timezones and potentially overlapping data into account.
%Researched and implemented methods for creating music/sound via a NeuroSky Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Combined multiple APIs to create an Android app that produces sounds controlled by various deliberate brain-wave measures.


\noindent\begin{large}\textsc{Front-end MVC Framework:}\end{large}\\
Developed a state-based, lightweight framework for a client's single-page web application. Created a custom solution due to client requirements. Applied Object Oriented Design principles to improve development time of the end product. Designed with reusability and security in mind.
